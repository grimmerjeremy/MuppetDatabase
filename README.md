# MuppetDatabase

The Muppet Database is a three part database.
1) Muppets
2) Performers
3) Movies/Shows

The muppets are tied to the performers through a foreign key.
All three layers will be tied together using complex keys during the stretch goals period.

This database utalizes an n-tier structured MVC.

In addition to allowing the user to add, update, delete, and view all of the individual muppets, performers, and movies/shows, 
the user will have the ability to add an image address to show a picture in the Details view for each object.
